I'm interested to add training in skills that are time-consuming to acquire and which are difficult to find the time to learn as a full-time researcher, and to enable me to work better with other researchers. 

As a University Data Champion, I'm interested in making data FAIR-er, and the JSON/API section will be helpful here, which will also help me to make better use of the OpenAQ Air Quality database as well. 

I want to make better use of the CMIP6 and CMIp5 data archive. The CMIP6 data set is hosted on a grid framework that I would be interested to make more of (using Globus endpoints etc). 

I'm particularly interested to use of the new high time frequency climate model data to look at future extreme air quality episodes, and in using climate data and machine learning to identify the meteorological precursor conditions for these events and to perform skilful early predictions of future events.

Interests in this course:

* Data analysis of structured data
* Developing visualisations and dashboards
* Automatic classification of data
* Forecasting
